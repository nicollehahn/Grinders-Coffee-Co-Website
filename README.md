# Grinders-Coffee-Co-Website
responsive site for coffee company

This was a site we worked on at Betamore Academy.  The site was designed & developed by Ben Plum.  
Apps used were Gridlock & Normalize, Grunt.  Initially we created the website, then we went back in to make it responsive.

Much coffee was imbibed whilest working on this project.
